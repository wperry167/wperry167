### Hi there, I'm Angela Walker! 👋

🚀 **Museum & Gallery Enthusiast** | 🌌 **Exhibition Specialist** | 🖌️ **Art Advocate**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little bit about me and what I'm up to:

---

#### 🧙‍♀️ **Who am I?**

By day, I work as a **Museum/Gallery Exhibitions Officer** at *Graves, Beck, and Norman*, helping to bring incredible art and culture to life for everyone to enjoy. My passion for art meets my love for technology here on GitHub, where I explore creative digital projects and contribute to the community.

#### 🔭 **Current Projects & Interests**

Lately, I’ve been diving into projects that blend technology and creativity. I’m particularly interested in:
- **Digital Exhibits** – Building virtual spaces where people can enjoy art from anywhere.
- **Art Analytics** – Using data to understand trends, visitor engagement, and to make exhibitions even more immersive.

#### 🌱 **Learning & Growth**

I'm currently leveling up my skills in **data visualization** and **web technologies** to better showcase art in new and exciting ways. I'm also exploring **AI for art curation**, where tech and creativity beautifully intersect!

#### 🌌 **Fun Facts**

- Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new galleries, trying my hand at digital art, and even a bit of painting myself.
- I’m on a mission to make art more accessible to people everywhere, blending traditional exhibits with digital tools.
